# ip-clean-duplicate-meta-keys

This is a devdeloper tool that can be used to remove duplicate post meta from the wordpress database. It will look through the post meta for any entries that have a duplicate meta_key and meta_value, and remove all of the duplicates.

After installation, the plugin settings can be found in Tools > Clean Meta Keys.

From the settings page, you can set this up to run on a schedule, or you can run the process manually.

To setup a schedule, change the number in the "Run cleanup every X days" section, then click the "Update Schedule" button

To run this as a one time manual process, click the "Run Cleanup Now" button.

You will see the results of the cleanup in the Recent Logs area on this settings page.
